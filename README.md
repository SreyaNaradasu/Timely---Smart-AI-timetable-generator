Smart AI Timetable Generator (CSP-based)
AI-driven scheduler built using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques.

Automatically generates conflict-free timetables for classes, teachers, and rooms.

Handles hard constraints like:

No teacher or student group in two places at once

Room availability and capacity

Subject-teacher mapping

Supports soft constraints like:

Preferred time slots

Balanced workload across days

Uses backtracking, forward checking, and MRV heuristics for efficient solving.

Customizable for schools, colleges, and training institutions.

Built using Python (or your language of choice) and supports JSON/CSV input for data
